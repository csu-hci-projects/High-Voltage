       <h1>Effectiveness of Augmented Reality as an Industrial Training Aid</h1>

        <h1>Augmented Reality, AR, can be an effective tool
in the delivery of technical training. AR engages the student
in a fresh new way and allows their location perception to
be engaged with the equipment functions being described. AR,
properly utilized, is an effective method of enhancing learning
and improved education outcomes.

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>This project will undertake the challenge of measuring
the efficacy of using AR as a method of delivering training
that fulfills the need for hands on training while conveying
the experience to the technical student in a meaningful and
memorable way. Additionally, I contend that this experience
will provide an increased level of retention over the more
traditional remote learning format of recorded videos.</p>
        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <p>By utilizing AR technology, an AWA-IV, Advanced Winding
Analyzer seen in figure 1, will be mapped to the test
device and provide points of interaction will be overlaid on
some of the analyzers primary interface buttons and dials,
concept image shown in figure 2. When the subject interacts
with the highlighted areas on the screen the application will
begin describing the proper operation and use of the control
feature selected. A video containing equivalent content will
also be produced as a training aid for comparison purposes by
experiment.</p>
        <h1>Results</h1>
        <p>Users felt that the AR experience was exciting and caused them to engage more with the training activity than previous video experiences had.
Users all tested at or above 80% on the delivered content.
Almost all users expressed frustration with the clickable interface.
Onscreen click detection was not the most sensitive and required several presses to initiate the audio portion.
</p>
        <h1>Discussion</h1>
        <p>From this study we have learned that the AR experience is not any more effective than traditional methods. It does however engage the students with a new excitement that they have not experienced before.Future work will use this feedback and create a novel experience that draws in users and improves the user experience so that it is seamless and intuitive.
